# Project Title (guitar-la)
 - A simple and responsive web application that simulates an online guitar store built with **Vue.js 3** and deployed on **Vercel**.  
This project was part of my learning journey into front-end development, helping me strengthen my understanding of **reactivity**, **component communication**, and **state management** in Vue.

## Technologies Used
- Vue.js 3 (Composition API)
- Vite
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Vercel (deployment)
- ## Features
- Add, edit, and delete items dynamically
- Reactive state management using `ref()`
- Parent-child communication using `props`, `emits`, and **custom events**  
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Local storage integration for persistent data 
- Watchers (`watch()`) to track state changes
- Use of **Vue directives** (`v-if`, `v-for`, `v-bind`)  
- Event handling for user interactions
- ## What I Learned
- Managing state and reactivity using the **Composition API** (`ref`,`computed`, and `watch`).
- Understanding how data flows between parent and child components.  
- Handling events and building custom event emitters between components.  
- Implementing **Vue directives** effectively for conditional rendering and dynamic lists.  
- Persisting user data locally using **localStorage**.  
- Deploying a modern front-end project using **Vercel**.
